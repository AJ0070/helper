Question: 30 day chargeback probation - Creator
Answer: <p>Hey,<br><br>Happy to clarify!<br><br>Since you have a higher-than-average chargeback rate (<strong>X.X</strong>% of your sales volume), we have been forced to pause your payouts for 30 days. If your chargeback rate has decreased after that period, your payouts will resume as normal. To be sure, you will still be able to make sales, create new products, contact your customers, and promote your products. The only thing that has changed is your payouts.<br><br>We don't do this to penalize you - this is a compromise we have struck with our banking partners. In the past, we would have been forced to suspend your account and refund your sales, but in the process, we hurt a lot of legitimate, honest creators. This is a measure to ensure that you can continue selling with us.<br><br>If customers who have issued chargebacks against you cancel their disputes, and your chargeback rate is thus lowered, we may be able to resume your payouts before the 30 days are up. We recommend that you reach out to your customers and ask them to do so.<br><br>Thanks for your patience and understanding!</p>

  URL: https://gumroad.com/help/article/10-dealing-with-vat.html

Analysis:
RECOMMENDATION: REMOVE

REASONING: The FAQ addresses a specific scenario where a buyer was not charged VAT due to the system not detecting an EU/UK IP at checkout. This situation is covered under the broader explanation of how VAT is handled on the "EU & UK VAT on Gumroad" page. The page explains that Gumroad manages VAT collection and remittance for digital sales in the EU and UK, which implies that if VAT is not charged, it is due to the system's detection process. The FAQ's mention of not being able to customize invoices or retroactively charge VAT is a detail that can be inferred from the general policy described on the website page. Therefore, the FAQ does not provide unique information that is not already covered by the website page.

Analysis:
RECOMMENDATION: KEEP

REASONING: The FAQ provides specific guidance on an issue that arises when a user changes their account email address and is unable to log in due to the new 2FA system.

The FAQ's detailed explanation and step-by-step guidance are not fully replicated on the website page.

Question: Why was my non-NSFW cosplay product flagged?
Answer: <p>Hi there!<br><br>Happy to help clarify the situation for you as best I can.<br><br>From our discussions with our partners, when they’ve specifically flagged cosplay accounts, they’ve done so for reasons such as:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>Nudity in the thumbnails or nudity or "lewd"ness being advertised as part of the product</p></li><li><p>Cosplayers in provocative or sexual poses&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Cosplayers pretending to be in sexual situations by themselves or with other models</p></li><li><p>Thumbnails emphasizing a model's boobs or butts in scantily clad outfits or “sexual areas” of the body</p></li></ul><p><br>This is such a subjective way to approach it, but if you look at the product and ask yourself, “Is the average customer only buying this product because it turns them on?" and the answer is "yes" then that product is likely going to be considered NSFW by our partners.&nbsp;<br><br>They have been ok with cosplay accounts that are more about the cosplayer's costume, or a celebration of the human body, if that makes sense. As in - the costumes may be a bit revealing, but the point of the account isn't nudity or sexual gratification.&nbsp;<br><br>All of that said, if you have not been contact by us directly, that means your account has not been flagged by our partners. If it is flagged, we'll tell you, and they'll give you a 10 day window to react and remove anything they find out of line with their Terms of Service. They'll then let us know if you can continue using us.<br><br>So, for the meantime, I would aim to be cautious about your products' descriptions, thumbnails, and content, and adjust those accordingly.<br><br>Thanks again!&nbsp;</p>
